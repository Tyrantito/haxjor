# haxjor
HaxJor is a native scriptting tool that can be used for HaxBall.


DEPRECATED!
Not removing this simply for reference. 
This wasn't inteded to be functionally and mainly created for learning and getting used with jNative.
Poor synchrounization, though with a few tweaking and optimization this shouldn't be a problem.
Also, Settings system could come in handy, it isn't really necessary for this tool but clearly would've come
in handy. So why is this discontinued? Simply due to lack of interest in the game, and also since I've found
a better method of doing this, by reflecting the client and snipping the avatar method through injection.
I'm sure nobody follows this, but this could be easily used to make a macro :)
