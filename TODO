V Currently the comparision for keychar and a keyboard indicator can fail, needs to be fixed. (also some random chars will also work)
V Get rid of debug methods
V Allow the settings file for each script to provide easy modifications.
V Figure how to set keyboard language when #type is called.
V Currently, exiting the program happens so we relay on the shutdown hook event since when #system.exit() is called,
 it also calls the shutdown event, and to demonstrate whether its a natural exit or unexpected one we set a flag depending on the state.
