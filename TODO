-Currently the comparision for keychar and a keyboard indicator can fail, needs to be fixed. (also some random chars will also work)
-Get rid of debug methods
-Proper command parsing system
-Finish all TODOs mentioned in files
-Commands to adjust settings.
-Allow the settings file for each script to provide easy modifications.
-Benchmarks for performance quality measures.
-Figure how to set keyboard language when #type is called.
-Currently, exiting the program happens so we relay on the shutdown hook event since when #system.exit() is called,
 it also calls the shutdown event, and to demonstrate whether its a natural exit or unexpected one we set a flag depending on the state.
